excerpt: "This portfolio site"

I made this portfolio site for the same reasons everyone else
makes their portfolios.

I plan on hosting another site, so I can save some money on
server time by using Gatsbyjs to generate the site as static files, 
and then use NGIX to serve them, while also using NGINX as a reverse
proxy to the Node.js application.
