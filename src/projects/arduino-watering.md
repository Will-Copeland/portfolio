This is the project that inspired me to start developing, as I
had a blast sorting out the logic as a noobie.

Tired of remembering to water the plants every morning and every evening,

I hacked together some parts from Amazon and created this fine specimen.


I ended up using an Arduino UNO, a 110v fluid valve, an
extension cord, RTC (Real-Time-Clock), and 110v relay module.

V2 will include a Bluetooth or WiFi module and an app that allows you to set the water events remotely. 

Also will be soldered and not just jammed into a breadboard,
in a tubberware, screwed into a wall.
