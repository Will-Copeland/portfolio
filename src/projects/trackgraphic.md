Very much under construction. 

I was somewhat involved with the data model on this project, and learned a lot about relational 
databases. Working with Apollo and GraphQL is leaps and bounds more intuitive than traditional 
RESTful APIs and I would very much like to work with it in the future. 


TrackGraphic was born as a concept for drivers to organize, compare, and compete at track events.
It will also be a crowdfunding platform and community, with a user-powered wiki.

The wiki will be filterable by type of car, like front-wheel drive or modified/stock.

Drivers will be able to post lap times and videos and receive feedback and tips from
more experienced drivers.

Right now, JCKB is competing in the Founders Institute Winter 2019 program for funding.

I am very excited for this platform and we have much more planned for this!

TrackGraphic will totally change the game for amatuer and semi-pro racing and fundraising.
Our end aim is to make the sport more accessible to newcomers and ease the curve to more advanced racing for
those already participating.
