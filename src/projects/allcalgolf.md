This website was made from the basics, HTML, CSS, and PHP. 
Of course, it utilizes WordPress's CMS API, but the site itself
doesn't have many bells and whistles. </br></br>
This was before I got started with React and became serious about web
development</br></br>
I actually took almost all the pictures you see on the site,
except for one or two.
