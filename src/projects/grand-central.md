excerpt: 'PWA for RR crossing reporting'
---


Grand Central was created to solve the CPUC's problem of 
rail road crossing saftey reporting. Previously, technicians 
had to write down their findings, then pair those with images
and send them off to be manually inputted into their database. 
This process was tedious and error-prone.

Grand Central solves this problem by recording responses 
using PouchDB and syncing with the server when connected to the
internet. The answers, pictures, and questions are all pre-sorted, related
and placed directly into the database. 

This prevents the need for someone to manually enter items and technicians spending hours
in hotel rooms pairing report items & answers with pictures.
          
It also allows for RR crossing "jobs" to be delegated by Role instead of Technician, this makes it easy to assign technicians different roles.
