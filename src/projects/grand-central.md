excerpt: 'PWA for RR crossing reporting'
---


   Grand Central was created to solve the CPUC's problem of 
          rail road crossing saftey reporting. Previously, technicians 
          had to write down their findings, then pair those with images
          and send them off to be manually inputted into their database. 
          This process was tedious and error-prone. </br></br>
          Grand Central solves this problem by recording responses 
          using PouchDB and syncing with the server when connected to the
          internet. The answers, pictures, and questions are all pre-sorted, related
          and placed directly into the database. </br></br>
          This prevents the need for someone to manually enter items and technicians spending hours
          in hotel rooms pairing report items & answers with pictures.
          </br></br>
          It also allows for RR crossing "jobs" to be delegated by Role instead of Technician, this makes it easy to assign technicians different roles.
